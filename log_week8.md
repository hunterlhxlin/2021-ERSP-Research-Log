# ERSP Research Log
## Week 8 (11.22-11.28)
### Goals:

- [x] Update research log
- [x] Meet and talk with porfesser and phd student via zoom
- [x] read the materials
- [x] testing the performance of algorithms with more options
- [x] analyze why performance is limited
- [x] keep writing research proposal

### Accomplishments (7.5 hours)
- Talked and think the main difference is the different distribution of the scores.
- Most dynamic pruning algorithms are implemented based on the maximum score of posting lists and blocks, thus tend to be more efficient when maximum can better represent the whole distribution. 
- However, as illustrated by the figures below, maximum scores tends to diverge more from the whole distribution, thus pruning become less efficient.

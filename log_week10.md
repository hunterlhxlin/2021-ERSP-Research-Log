# ERSP Research Log
## Week 5 (10.25-10.31)
### Goals:

- [x] Update research log
- [x] Interview phd student


### Accomplishments(3 hours)
- Review for final tests and working on final projects, not too much work this week
- Interview our mentor Yifan Qiao
- How did you decided to go to graduate school? How did you decide on a masters'/PhD over the other option?
  - Have interest in doing research, also in China often a bachelor degree may not be enough. Choose phd because it's cheaper than grad school
- Did you work before going to graduate school?
  - Not really, only two internships
- How did you select UCSB? What factors were important to you?
  - Good environment and location. Next to the sea, slower pace of life and work than big cities or universities in China
  - Instructors and professor match my research interest
- What undergraduate experience/course work/project work was most important in helping prepare you for graduate work and research?
  - During undergrad, worked in an NLP lab at Tsinghua University
  - About how to use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to improve information retrieval tasks and ranking
  - Exactly one of the main focus of current research 
- Is graduate school what you thought it would be like? What is it like? What did you expect? How are these the same/different?
  - Well, after doing research on my own, seems like they are not that mysterious or complex as I thought
- Tell me about a time that you've been frustrated or discouraged with your research? How did you get through it? What did you do?
  - During undergrad, terrible at training neural networks or related machine learning models
  - Worked really hard but can hardly get similar outcome with others
  - solution: changed research focus when start phd
- What's your favorite part about doing research? Tell me about a good research experience you have had.
  - Intern at Apple: help improve the searching of the email app of IOS
  - add suggestion to what users may want to search when they type something on the search bar
  - favorite part: reading a lot of related works and implement ideas in the paper
  - get better result than gmail
- What's your favorite aspect of graduate school (the whole thing, not just research or classes)? Your least favorite?
  - A lot more free time than undergrad
  - travel, photography, get a pilot license
  - more diverse life
  - though this also means lack of goals, more uncertainty
  - currently the research progess is kind of left behind
- What's your relationship like with your adviser?
  - Very good. Prof Yang is kind and can always consider issues from students' perspective, not pushy.
- My own questions
- Any plan after phd? go to big companies or post-doc, professor track
  - probably go to some big tech company
  - maybe another intern at apple summer 2022
- Any other field of interest during undergrad? Why not choose these areas for phd
  - computer graphics: the industry got monopolized by several big companies, probably hard to get good offer. also rejected by Lingqi at UCSB
  - human computer interaction(HCI): this field is more about researchers' sudden inspiration. Intersted but probably not talented in this field
- Seems like I've learned a lot about CS but when I want to implement something from scratch I hardly have any idea. Also hard to connect things I learned. Have you encountered this issue? how did you solve this?
  - Have been through this during undergrad
  - Will get better when you learn more and more and have more experience on projects

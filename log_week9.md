# ERSP Research Log
## Week 9 (11.29-12.5)
### Goals:

- [x] Update research log
- [x] Meet and talk with porfesser and phd student via zoom
- [x] read the materials
- [x] testing the performance of algorithms with more options
- [x] keep writing research proposal, improve base on feedback

### Accomplishments (5.5 hours)
- test the performance of algorithms with different query length
- First a rough analysis
- With block size 256, top_k 100
- ![Outcome](/len.png)
- Morespecifically, though some query length only have a few examples, thus may not bu accurate enough

#### Log Reflections
- How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?  
  
People use different ways to record their weekly achievements and accomplishments and used different types of files to store their research logs. Some prefer to use short paragraphs for everything, where as some used checkboxes and bullet points. Some directly wrote all the content in the file, whereas others may have external link for each individual notes of each week. Personally, I prefer using Github Markdown alone with bullet points and checkboxes, because I think this way all the content will be more organized. The signs and indentations really improved the visual effects of the logs. Also I prefer attach all the notes, data, tables, graphs, etc. directly in this Markdown file, since this will boost the readability of the entire log and I can easily locate the content I want to retrieve by simply searching one file. 

- How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?

- Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?

#### Log Reflections
- How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?
  - People use different ways to record their weekly achievements and accomplishments and used different types of files to store their research logs. Some prefer to use short  paragraphs for everything, where as some used checkboxes and bullet points. Some directly wrote all the content in the file, whereas others may have external link for each       individual notes of each week. Personally, I prefer using Github Markdown alone with bullet points and checkboxes, because I think this way all the content will be more         organized. The signs and indentations really improved the visual effects of the logs. Also I prefer attach all the notes, data, tables, graphs, etc. directly in this Markdown file, since this will boost the readability of the entire log and I can easily locate the content I want to retrieve by simply searching one file. 

- How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?
  - For researchers, writing down each step is definitely useful. Since we will be readin a lot of new materials, keeping a basic index will help us to retrieve what we learned easier, very convenient for review or reflection. Also this log will help everyone in the group and the instructors to track others progress with this project. Others can       know if someone's struggling immediately and help them. This can also help to improve the efficiency of all the group meetings and discussions - it's simple, skim others'       logs. 

- Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?
  - I think this helps a lot. Keeping a list of to-dos will remind students to keep working on the research and don't forget anything. From the samples we are given, I can see that all the students completed most of their goals the set at the begining of each week and eventually led to their success in their researches. I believe writing this log force students to always keep things in mind. This way they will remember to always leave time for weekly readings, coding, etc. and help to prevent procrastination.

### Goals:

- [x] Update research log
- [x] Meet and talk with porfesser and phd student via zoom
- [x] read the materials
- [x] figure out methods to implement DeepImpact and test with it
- [x] Group meeting

### Accomplishments (8 hours)
- read through everything we found that is related to the current paper and see what we can do.
- This specific one that introdunce 
- Read about Deep Learning so that I can actually understand how the DeepImpact scoring system in the paper
- Learn about gradient descent and neural network via videos online
- setup tensorflow on my laptop to see if we can make the DeepImpact algorithm work on my device
